297 | XSS | By adding a link in a post and manually editing out a portion (`denied:`), then reblogging the post, the XSS will execute after the victim clicks the link (on the reblogged post). | $350 | Automattic | https://hackerone.com/reports/882546
298 | Command Injection | Since GitLab allows for code injection through Mermaid, you can achieve arbitrary PUT requests in the context of the victim through this command injection. The victim has to have the required privilege to perform the action for the attack to succeed. | $3000 | Gitlab | https://hackerone.com/reports/824689
299 | SQLi | An SQL Injection existed in a Razer Gold asset due to using an outdated instance of PHPlist. The injection point is the _body parameter **name**_ and not the value!  | $2000 | Razer | https://hackerone.com/reports/824307
300 | Code injection | Due to a vulnerability in how the executable launched related executables, it was possible to escalate privileges by abusing this issue.
